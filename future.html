         <h2>Some thoughts</h2>
         <p>At this point in my life, the most important thing to me is to figure out what I want to do. Computer Science is a broad major, and honestly, I find almost all of them equally interesting (definitely not because of me being indecisive).</p>
         <br>
         <h2>While at University</h2>
         <p>I cannot speak well about what the future holds, especially in the tech world, where everything changes rapidly. But I hope to prepare myself best to improvise and accept great opportunities when the time comes. Looking at the rest of my time in university, I am strongly interested in research, so hopefully, I can land a research internship. Moreover, another internship working on a practical project would help me a lot to see the two sides of Computer Science. For now, I have to stay locked in, focus on my studying and be the better version of myself every day.</p>
         <br>
         <h2>After University</h2>
         <p>Once I graduated, I hope that I can get a stable job and working visa in Australia, that's all for now :)</p>
         <br>
         <h2>My Goals while still at Uni</h2>
         <p>Ranked on a scale of 1-5, 1 is the most important and 5 is the least important.</p>
         <ol>
            <li>Make new friends</li>
            <li>Get an internship</li>
            <li>Achieve good grades</li>
            <li>Join exchange program to an university abroad</li>
            <li>Meet Gordon Ramsay</li>
         </ol>
