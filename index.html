         <p>Hello again, my name is Tung Nguyen, but you can call me Cole! I'm a second-year (as of 2024) Computer Science student from Vietnam. <br><br>
            I have a love-hate relationship with programming. Most of the time, it just gives me the hardest time. But when it is a good time, it feels like nothing else in the world. To prepare myself as a programmer, I make sure to have several healthy hobbies. I like playing basketball, guitar, getting myself lost on YouTube and fixing things. I would fix literally anything, but my success rate is well below 30%. My celebrity crush is Gordon Ramsay, and my irrelevant fear is tall people.

         <p>Enough about me, let's guide you through this digital realm, shall we? At the very top, there are three buttons, each taking you through the respective path. The past will take you to my computing past; the future will take you to my computing dream. The comment is where you'll see honest reflection and thoughts about this website. So, choose wisely. Scrolling down, you'll see a gallery. You can hover your mouse to read the description of each image. Also, you probably already noticed, the text pops up if you hover over it too. Same thing won't happen if you use a mobile device, I'm not that good of a developer yet.<br><br>May your clicks be swift, your scrolls smooth, and your laughter abundant as you navigate this cyber wonderland :)</p>
