         <h2>Where it all started</h2>
         <p>My coding journey started all the way back in Secondary school. My first interaction with programming was with a mandatory Pascal course; it could have been more pleasant. I then moved on to Scratch and Minecraft Hour of Code, which was very cool. I felt like that was something, but I didn't think much about it afterwards. </p>
         <br>		
         <h2>High School Programming</h2>
         <p>Fast forward to High school, when suddenly programming became a trend, I felt the peer pressure to get back on track. I decided to learn Swift as I was trying to be different. As anticipated, I was roasted for learning a "no-name" language by all of the Windows fanboys. But now Swift is available on Windows, so I guess it was all right after all. Then Covid happened, and I got bored and stuck at home. To pass my time away, I tried joining Harvard CS50 Introduction to Computer Science course. It was an excellent course, and it really got me into computer science. But it was very tough, and I still haven't finished it.</p>
         <br>
         <h2>A fresh start at Uni</h2>
         <p>Here I am today. I went to UTS directly after high school. My first semester ever was my first time doing some serious coding. I have finished Programming 1 and Database Fundamentals,and I'm doing Programming 2 and Web System.I learned a lot and had a fantastic opportunity to be a UPASS Leader for Programming 1. If you are struggling with Programming 1, feel free to hop into my UPASS, and we can have a good time learning together.</p>
